    &content=`<p>Electrons, according to Wikipedia, are generally thought to be 
elementary particles because they have no known components or 
substructure. They play an essential role in numerous physical 
phenomena, such as electricity. They also function as a bonding 
mechanism for atomic systems.<br>
</p><p>Translated to MODX, things like TV's, Context Settings and System Settings can be interpreted as electrons. These elements contain small bits of information, that flow through the system (like electricity) to keep things in line with certain values. So essentially, they too bind things together.
</p><p>Although not present in Brad Frosts' original Atomic Design principles, Electrons play a vital role in Romanesco as distributors of information. And like the rest of the Atomic elements, they are structured to be reusable.</p>`
